Ultimately I hope you can run something like this:

```
./bin/build_sitemap.py
./bin/build_content.py
```

and it'll build the stories in a more modern layout, without all the image map stuff.

For now, you can run something along the lines of:
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 build.sh
```

and then some of the website shows up in the build/ directory.
